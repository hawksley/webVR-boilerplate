<!--

This is the standard ThreeJS-based boilerplate for webVR
	currently being used by the eleVR team.

It has oculus support for webVR browsers, support for the non-VR web,
	and support for smartphone on google cardboard or similar VR device.

Supported Navigation Controls:
	WASD + E/Q navigation support for rotation.
	Arrow key navigation support for moving the location of the camera.
	Gamepad joystick navigation controls.
	Orientation control with a VR headset OR mobile phone.

Click to enter full-screen VR mode.

This boilerplate is based on Mozilla's boilerplate: https://github.com/MozVR/vr-web-examples/tree/master/threejs-vr-boilerplate

It has been developed with the help of a great many people including (but not limited to) Vi Hart, Andrew Lutomirski, Henry Segerman, and the Firefox webVR team.
